description: A list of mer tails!

Mer tails come in all shapes and sizes! From dry tails to wet (ones you can use in the water).

Depending on what you want in a tail and how much you can and want to spend! You don't have to be one or another if you are like me I have about 7!

Make sure to research the type of monofin as well as tail that you want.    
If your dream is to have a silicon first start in a monifin then add a fabric tail skin. Don't go straight for silicon as you might end up spending a LOT more money then you think and find that it's not for you.

# Fabric
Just because you have a fabric tail it doesn't make you any less of a Mer!!!

Some fabric tails are amazing just make sure it's safe.

# Silicon
Silicon tails are a work of ART and because of that are more expensive and more likely to be one of a kind!
