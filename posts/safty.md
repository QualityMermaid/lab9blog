Safty tips for safe Mering!

## Dry
Have someone with you   
Don't standup in a swimming tail and monofin


## Wet   
Swim with others   
Know your swim limits
Remember to take plenty of deep breaths between swims underwater   
Supervision is ALWAYS required       
NEVER put arms inside tail skins they are a tail not a sleeping bag!   
Don't swim in deeper water than your ability.   
If you cannot swim in a monofin on its own DON'T put it in a tail skin.
